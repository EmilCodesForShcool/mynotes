## INTRODUCTION + VIBE BOARD

A divided world between the glamorous upper level and the less than presentable lower level

The roaring 20s + DnD like fantasy

The all knowing eye, knowledge is both a blessing, and a curse to him. He carries the burden of possesing forbidened knowledge about this world.

He was manufactured as a vessel by The Order for containg knowledge and was raised within it as a child. His mind is sharper than the sharpest of blades, which isn't always a good thing. The more he knows, the less he trusts his own reality. Is his world even real?

The judge, fairness doesn't come easily to someone who is so rigid. But, her love for rules is the best thing that she has (at the time being) to create it. She is the highest law enforcer that the The Order has to offer.

Her rigidness both serves and harms her. Knowing that exceptions need to be made is hard for her since her only exception is now "the elephant in the room" in every of the Archangels' meetings.

Raguel - Justice

Michael - Protector

The protector, a battle - torn veteran which abilities that both shine on and off the battle field. He is the Order's current highest authority.

The general, the face of war couldn't have been gentler. Behind that calming demenor is a ruthless and unforgiving tactian when provoked enough. Some may say that his tolerance for provication could be considered as being cold.

He's responsible for overseeing The Order's army and provide command when nessecary.

Chamuel - Peace

The diplomat, with an firery personality that is less than ideal for diplomacy, she sometimes wonder why she got this position when joining the Archangels. Behind that exterior is a heart yearing for warmth and love between all.

She ensures that her brother's name may never be called by exhausting as many peacful solutions as possible.

Camael - War

The healer, her compassion is both her biggest strength and most lethal weakness. She is the benevolent healer known and loved by all citizens.

Another vessel made by "The Order", she was made with empathy in mind. Never too afraid to help, though this attribute has gotten her into rather... painful situations. For the time being, she's considered missing after the incident.

The warrior, his physical strength is outmatched (as the Archangel of Strength should be), it is unclear that the same could be said about his mental strength. 

The Order's third vessel created for the sole purpose of being their "indestructable messenger". He's just as carefree as the winds the he rides to deliver their messages, which isn't paticularly want you want in a "warrior".
