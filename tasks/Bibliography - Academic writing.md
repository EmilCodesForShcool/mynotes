Writing an annotated bibliography
Why:
- discover what your source contain
- how to best use that information
What does it look like:
Citation of the source (in whatever format you need) + What that source has (you can be as specific as you want: page number, chapter name so that you won’t need to read again)

⇒ Keep track of your sources

How to cheese with ChatGPT (what to have in your prompt):
- Read and summarize
- Extract information that are useful in a research about “…”
- Compile it into a 100 - word annotated bibliography

Make 10 from 10 different sources
Sources for my fricking research:

	- https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/pure-fiction/
	- https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/apocalypticshadow/

- Plan on how to use: Get ratings from prydwen, get the enemy lineup from official source, use the team rec as sources for reasoning what is prioritized, analyse character kits to lineup what the character's kit and what the meta needs.

1. Prydwen Institute. (2026). Memory of Chaos Analytics (3.8). Prydwen.gg. https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/memory-of-chaos.This source contains statistics about character usage rates in the current Memory of Chaos. The data is collected from players that have cleared stage 12 - the final stage of this challenge during patch 3.8. Characters with higher usage (percentages) are more favored by players, since they appear more in successful clears of stage 12. 12 characters with the highest usage rates are: Hyacine, Castorice, Cyrene, Evernight, Dan Heng Permansor Terrare, The Dahlia, Firefly, Fugue, Tribie, Sunday, Phainon and Lingsha. This source will serve as data to back up claims that are related to what characters are the most optimal for this current challenge. 
2. HoYoLAB. (2025). *Version 3.8 Treasures Lightward Schedule*. HoYoLAB. [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/42766421](https://www.hoyolab.com/article/42766421?utm_source=chatgpt.com) .This source contains the description of power-ups and enemy line ups of 3 of the game's hardest challenges: Memory of Chaos, Pure Fiction and Apocalyptic Shadow. The power-up in Memory of Chaos prioritizes characters that use a lot of skill points (a resource needed by a team to use skills) along with Break (depleting an enemy's white "Toughness" bar using matching elemental attacks), AoE and DoT mechanics. Pure Fiction's power - ups and enemy line up benefits characters that use Break and skill point mechanics or the characters that are on the path of Remembrance. Apocalyptic Shadow's power-ups and enemy line up are beneficial to character of the Physical element, Remembrance path or characters that can heal others. This information allows me to deduce which characters are the optimal for the current enemies and power-ups by knowing what mechanics are currently being favored.
3. Prydwen Institute. (2026). *Pure Fiction Analytics*. Prydwen.gg. https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/pure-fiction/. This source contains statistics about character usage rates in the current Pure Fiction. The data is collected from players who have cleared the stage 4 - the final stage of Pure Fiction during patch 3.8. 12 characters that have the highest appearance rates are: Hyacine, Castorice, Cyrene, Evernight, Tribie, Dan Heng Permansor Terrare, The Dahlia, Fugue, Firefly, Remembrance Trailblazer, The Herta, and Lingsha. These characters that are able to deal damage to multiple enemies at once in the form of pure damage, break damage or damage over time are highly favored in this challenge. This source will serve as data to back up claims that are related to what characters are the most optimal for this current challenge.
4. Prydwen Institute. (2026). _Honkai: Star Rail Tier list_. Prydwen.gg. [https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/tier-list](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/tier-list?utm_source=chatgpt.com). This source contains a custom rating system made by Prydwen to rate characters on how relevant they are in different game modes. The tier list categorized characters into meta brackets, including: Apex Characters (T0 & T0.5) - current most optimal characters, Meta characters (T1 - T2) - reliable characters but they need more investment to use effectively, Off - meta characters (T3 - T4) - viable but are less optimal than meta characters and the forgotten ones (T5) - characters that are unviable and struggles with with this type of game content. Additionally, characters are categorized by their role (DPS, Support DPS, Amplifier, Sustain) along with tags having information about synergy with other characters. This source serves as a reference for rating different characters and determine who are most effective.

This source provides a guide to approaching floor 12 - the hardest level of Memory of Chaos through analyzing enemies, power-ups and team suggestions. The current power-up deals damage based on the amount of skill points used by a character, the more skill points used, the higher the damage dealt. Some suggested teams include: Firefly, Fugue, Harmony Trailblazer and The Dahlia or Anaxa, Cerydra, Cyrene and Sunday. This source also include gameplay tips such as what enemy to prioritize defeating first or how to deal with specific enemy mechanics. Teams that are able to balance damage, sustain and utility are crucial for effective clearing against enemies with HP and strong attacks.
