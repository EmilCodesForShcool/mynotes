Writing an annotated bibliography
Why:
- discover what your source contain
- how to best use that information
What does it look like:
Citation of the source (in whatever format you need) + What that source has (you can be as specific as you want: page number, chapter name so that you won’t need to read again)

⇒ Keep track of your sources

How to cheese with ChatGPT (what to have in your prompt):
- Read and summarize
- Extract information that are useful in a research about “…”
- Compile it into a 100 - word annotated bibliography

Make 10 from 10 different sources
Sources for my fricking research:
- https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/memory-of-chaos: has characters with highest usage rates
	- https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/pure-fiction/
	- https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/apocalypticshadow/
- Line up for MoC, PF, AS (from hoyo offical account): [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/42766421](https://www.hoyolab.com/article/42766421: Official enemy lineup + turbulance

- Plan on how to use: Get ratings from prydwen, get the enemy lineup from official source, use the team rec as sources for reasoning what is prioritized, analyse character kits to lineup what the character's kit and what the meta needs.

1. This source contains statistics about character usage rates in the current Memory of Chaos. The data is collected from players that have cleared stage 12 - the final stage of this challenge during patch 3.8. Characters with higher usage (percentages) are more favored by players, since they appear more in successful clears of stage 12. 12 characters with the highest usage rates are: Hyacine, Castorice, Cyrene, Evernight, Dan Heng Permansor Terrare, The Dahlia, Firefly, Fugue, Tribie, Sunday, Phainon and Lingsha. This source will serve as data to back up claims that are related to what characters are the most optimal for this current challenge. 
2. This source contains the description of power-ups and enemy line ups of 3 of the game's hardest challenges: Memory of Chaos, Pure Fiction and Apocalyptic Shadow. The power-up in Memory of Chaos prioritizes characters that use a lot of skill points (a resource needed by a team to use skills) along with Break (depleting an enemy's white "Toughness" bar using matching elemental attacks), AoE and DoT mechanics. Pure Fiction's power - ups and enemy line up benefits characters that use Break and skill point mechanics or the characters that are on the path of Remembrance. Apocalyptic Shadow's power-ups and enemy line up are beneficial to character of the Physical element, Remembrance path or characters that can heal others. This information allows me to deduce which characters are the optimal for the current enemies and power-ups by knowing what mechanics are currently being favored.
3. This source contains statistics about character usage rates in the current Pure Fiction. The data is collected from players who have cleared the stage 4 - the final stage of Pure Fiction during patch 3.8. 12 characters that have the highest appearance rates are: Hyacine, Castorice, Cyrene, Evernight, Tribie, Dan Heng Permansor Terrare, The Dahlia, Fugue, Firefly, Remembrance Trailblazer, The Herta, Lingsha. Characters that can deal damage to multiple enemies at once in the form of pure damage, break damage or damage over time are highly favored in this challenge. This source will serve as data to back up claims that are related to what characters  are the most optimal for this current challenge.
