Writing an annotated bibliography
Why:
- discover what your source contain
- how to best use that information
What does it look like:
Citation of the source (in whatever format you need) + What that source has (you can be as specific as you want: page number, chapter name so that you won’t need to read again)

⇒ Keep track of your sources

How to cheese with ChatGPT (what to have in your prompt):
- Read and summarize
- Extract information that are useful in a research about “…”
- Compile it into a 100 - word annotated bibliography

Make 10 from 10 different sources
Sources for my fricking research:
- Prydwen: [https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/tier-list/](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/tier-list/): has characters with highest usage rates
- Line up for MoC, PF, AS (from hoyo offical account): [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/42766421](https://www.hoyolab.com/article/42766421: Official enemy lineup + turbulance
- Team recommendations for AS + reasoning: https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/best-teams-honkai-star-rail-hsr-3-8-apocalyptic-shadow-dominance-netherveil
- Team recs + strat guides for MoC: https://www.ldshop.gg/blog/honkai-star-rail/honkai-star-rail-memory-of-chaos.html
- Team recs + strat for PF: https://www.ldshop.gg/blog/guide/best-team-for-pure-fiction.html 
- Char guides for 
	- DPS (big characters that will have strats around them):
		- Firefly: https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/characters/firefly
		- Phainon: https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/characters/phainon
		- Anaxa: https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/characters/anaxa
		- Castorice: https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/characters/castorice
		- Archer: https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/characters/archer
		- Hysilens: https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/characters/hysilens

- Plan on how to use: Get ratings from prydwen, get the enemy lineup from official source, use the team rec as sources for reasoning what is prioritized, analyse character kits to lineup what the character's kit and what the meta needs.

1. This source contains the highest character usage rates for each of the game's endgame game mode. The characters that are at tier (T0) are prioritized as being the fastest and most optimal to clear a specific type of content. The list is divided into different groups of characters: DPS (Damage Dealers), Debuff, Healers/ Shielders and Support (Damage Amplifiers). This list contains the foundational information on the most optimal characters in different game modes in Honkai Star Rail. This source will help me point out optimal characters for ease of team building.
2. This source contains the description of power-ups and enemy line ups of 3 of the game's different game modes: Memory of Chaos, Pure Fiction and Apocalyptic Shadow. Knowing about power-ups and enemy line ups allows me to know what mechanics are currently favored by the game, therefore, allowing me to know which characters are optimal for the current enemies.
